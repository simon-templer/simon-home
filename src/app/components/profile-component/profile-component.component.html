    I am a designer and art director currently living in Stuttgart, Germany. Half German half Italian, I like to bring
    the best of both worlds into my design which is known for its sophisticated simplicity and thoughtful details. In
    2012 I founded my own creative studio to specialize in branding, web and print design and to work with ambitious
    business owners from all over the globe. I am passionate about helping my clients bringing their brands to life and
    telling their stories visually. My intention is to capture a brand's personality by developing comprehensive and
    compelling brand identities and designs.
